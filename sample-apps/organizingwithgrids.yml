- 内容: If you tap a color in the grid, you’ll notice that the text element on top of
    the grid changes color.
  提示: ''

- 内容: Inside the LazyVGrid, you define each item for the grid to display. To do this,
    you use a ForEach loop to iterate over the allColors array. By using the color’s
    name as an identifier, ForEach can find the right element when it needs to update
    the color’s view.
  提示: ''

- 内容: Inside the ScrollView, you create a grid view using LazyVGrid. The grid is “lazy”
    because it doesn’t create its grid items until they are needed. LazyVGrid takes
    an argument for columns which determines how many columns show up in the grid.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: To populate the grid with different colors, you’ll use the allColors variable
    to store an array of color values. The grid iterates over this array and adds
    a rectangular button for each color in the array.

- 内容: When you create a new app, ContentView is configured as your top-level view
    by default. This is useful because you can go to ContentView to see how an app’s
    views are put together. However, this view can be renamed, so if you’re unsure
    what the top-level view of an app is, look here in the body property of the app
    definition.

- 内容: Welcome to the Organizing with Grids sample. This sample shows you how to arrange
    content using a grid view, and how to use a state variable to track the selection
    of a color in that grid.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The Text view uses selectedColor for its foreground color. Because selectedColor
    is a state variable, whenever the state changes, SwiftUI changes the color of
    this text.
  提示: ''

- 内容: Let people edit data that your app displays.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: When your app runs, it displays whatever content you place in the body property.
    Notice that this body creates the ContentView. When the app launches, it fills
    the screen with this view.

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The first view inside ContentView is a VStack, which arranges its views vertically,
    with some text above the grid.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Each item in the grid is a Button view, and each button has an action (something
    that happens when you tap it), and a label (text or an image that tells people
    what the button does, like “Save” to save a file).
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The grid might contain more items than it can display at one time, so the code
    wraps it in a ScrollView to scroll the content vertically, if necessary.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: When you tap a grid element, the selectedColor value changes to that element’s
    color, which also changes the color of the text.

- 内容: This is the ContentView. It creates a grid of rounded rectangles, each a different
    color. ContentView is a View, so it can contain any number of other views inside
    of it. The grid is one of those views.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You’ll add any code that defines a view to the view’s body. You’ll define any
    variables that ContentView needs outside of its body.

- 内容: The code marks ColorGridApp with @main, making it the entry point of the program
    — the code the app starts running first.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 1
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You add @State before a variable to tell SwiftUI to manage the storage for a
    value. When the value changes, SwiftUI updates any parts of the view that use
    the value. The state variable selectedColor tracks the most recently selected
    color, which the text at the top of the view uses for its foreground color.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Before diving into the grid, take a look at how this code gets made into an
    app. Your ColorGridApp follows a set of guidelines created by the App protocol.
    This allows your project to run and behave just like any other app.
