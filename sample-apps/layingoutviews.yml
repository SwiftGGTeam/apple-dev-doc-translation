- 内容: Because all views are unique, different types of views have their own space
    requirements within a container. This is why the Rectangle view adjusts how much
    space it takes up, but the Text and Image only take up as much space as they need.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: There is just one more thing to fix. By default any content inside the frame
    is center-aligned. However, the crown at the center of the HalfCard needs to align
    to the bottom edge of HalfCard.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Can you think of anyway to fix this so the contents of the VStack fill the entire
    frame?

- 内容: You can also organize your views on top of each other using a ZStack. To stack
    a circle view on top of a rectangle, the views need to be put into a ZStack.

- 内容: Try it out yourself by going to the Swift Playgrounds App to practice laying
    out views for a journal app!
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: If you add the frame to the Text view, the actual text inside the view doesn’t
    change — it makes the view holding the text larger. This allows for more text
    to fit into the view.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Organize, size and align view layouts.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Look at the difference in the blue and green borders. The blue border surrounds
    the squished graphics in the VStack, but doesn’t expand into the empty surrounding
    space of the green frame.

- 内容: By applying the padding modifier to the VStack, you only have to add it once
    instead of adding it to every subview inside the VStack.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Try adding in the alignment: .leading parameter to your VStack and see what
    happens.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Start by setting height of your card. There are many different ways to lay out
    a view and using .frame(minHeight:maxHeight:) is just one way you can set the
    height.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Using both can help get a precise size for an image that is not distorted or
    too large.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: If you want to make the text bigger or different than the default, you can add
    the font(_:) modifier to your Text view.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Now that you’ve gone through all of the different parts for laying out a view,
    it’s time to bring them all together to see how you can use it when creating a
    view for a real app.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You could add horizontal padding to every row of shelves and books, but that’s
    a lot of work and not easy to maintain. Instead, apply modifiers to the container
    view. In this case, the container is the VStack.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: It’s the queen of hearts playing card (or, it’s supposed to be 😵‍💫). As the
    name suggests, HalfCard contains half a card. You use two HalfCard instances in
    a VStack to create this view. Then, flip the bottom HalfCard upside down to form
    a mirror image of the top HalfCard. By combining the top and bottom halves, you
    create a full playing card.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: A SwiftUI View determines its size based on the space offered by its container
    view. That’s why this rectangle is taking up the entire view – because that’s
    what the parent VStack is doing.

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Note
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: To adjust the amount of space views need, you can specify which view needs to
    take up more space. The frame(width:height:alignment:) allows you to adjust the
    size of a view. The frame modifier is setting a specific height and width for
    the rose image view.
  提示: ''

- 内容: Refine the spacing and alignment of your views
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Woohoo! Now you have all the tools to create your own views.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Different types of views and circumstances require different techniques. To
    learn more about the size and spacing of views, see Laying out a simple view.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You may have noticed that you have stacks that contain other stacks. SwiftUI
    organizes and tracks the relationships of views using a view hierarchy.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Notice that there are Text and Image views in your VStack. No matter how big
    the screen you’re using, the Text and Image views take up exactly the amount of
    space they need depending on the size of the content.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Debug your views when something goes wrong.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You can also add padding to the .trailing edge the image view to position it
    further from the edge.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Adding the alignment: .leading parameter to your VStack aligns the books to
    the left edge of the screen. This is because the VStack is the container view
    and the images and shapes are subviews.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: There are more containers than just HStack, VStack, and ZStack views. To explore
    different containers and how to use them to lay out your content, see Picking
    container views for your content
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Adding resizable after frame causes a compiler error. Applying the frame modifier
    to the Image actually creates a new view that’s no longer an Image, so it doesn’t
    have access to the resizable modifier.

- 内容: Bringing it all together
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: By setting the maxWidth to .infinity, you stretch the Image view horizontally
    until it fills the remaining space. Setting alignment parameter to .trailing makes
    the frame contents align to the .trailing edge.

- 内容: Adding a border to a view is a great debugging tool because it allows you to
    see how much space a view occupies. You can use this technique to diagnose lots
    of issues in your code.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 7
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 5
  提示: ''

- 内容: Views can also resize to fit their content such as Text(“Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious”)
    or Image("myCoolImage").
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Views are somewhat magical, in that certain view types control how they resize
    when placed in a container. They can expand to fill the available space, such
    as Rectangle or other Shape.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: When your SwiftUI views don’t show up as you expect, you’ll need to flex your
    debugging skills to fix them. Start by looking at the view displayed in the preview
    — it’s clearly not showing up correctly! 😩 Can you guess what this view is supposed
    to be?
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Tip
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: What if you switched up the order of the overlay and the frame? That would allow
    you to expand the frame first, which gives you extra space, then apply the overlay
    where it fits.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Often times you need to add size constraints to images since they can be extremely
    large.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: With the card title aligned, add padding to create space between the title of
    the view and the edge of the card. By adding padding to the VStack, you are applying
    padding to every view within the VStack.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You might wonder, why would it make a difference if you apply the border before
    or after the frame? This is because you actually produce a new view each time
    you apply a modifier, so the order that you apply them really matters. See Configuring
    views for more on this.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 11
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Any code applied to the HalfCard view affects both the top and bottom halves
    of the card, allowing you to fix issues in both halves at the same time.

- 内容: Another way to align books to the other side of the shelf is to use a frame
    modifier and specify the alignment.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: There are multiple ways to specify alignment in SwiftUI. One way is to specify
    the alignment inside HStack, VStack, or ZStack. The default alignment for a VStack
    is centered.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: In horizontal stacks you can only set the vertical alignment, like .top or .bottom.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: But wait, there’s more! You can also create space in a view with a Spacer.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The Spacer only fills in the empty space in the HStack. On the contrary, if
    there is no space available for the spacer, it won’t render.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When creating an app, one of the first skills to learn is how to lay out your
    user interface, or UI. When laying out a UI, there are three major things you
    need to do:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 2
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: A better way to do this is to give a maximum, minimum, or ideal width and height
    for a view. This allows the view to resize as necessary based on how much space
    is available in the container.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You just learned about three different ways to align your views. Using the alignment
    parameter in the container view, adding a frame modifier with the alignment parameter
    and utilizing a Spacer are all great ways to align your views.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Try removing the existing frame and add a new one right below the top-level
    VStack.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Explore other padding options such as .leading, .top, .bottom, .horizontal,
    and so on.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Setting the minHeight and maxHeight allows the view to scale for different screen
    sizes.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You can also specify the spacing as a parameter for the HStack. This changes
    the horizontal spacing between every subview inside the HStack.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Fetch structured data from a server asynchronously.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'There are two ways to align the crown to the bottom of your HalfCard view.
    You can add the alignment parameter to the frame– .frame(maxWidth: .infinity,
    maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .bottom) Or, add a Spacer above the crown.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Add a yellow background color to the image next to the Spacer to visualize how
    much space it’s creating.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Modify and determine view sizes
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: If you want to organize a pair of circles horizontally, you can use an HStack.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Fine tune the sizing, spacing, alignment, and positioning of your views.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Having a .frame modifier with a maxWidth of .infinity stretches the Text view
    horizontally and fills the available space. The alignment parameter ensures that
    any content inside the frame aligns to the leading edge.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Different views have different space requirements; not all views take up the
    same amount of space.

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: When you use the frame modifer on an Image it only affects the size of the displayed
    image if you first use the .resizable modifier to indicate that you want the image
    to be resized as its frame changes.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Shape views expand to fill the entire space that’s offered by the container
    view. Because there are two shape views that need to share the space in the VStack
    equally, their sizes adapt accordingly.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 13
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 4
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Even though the frame expanded, all of the graphics are still squished together.
    Add another border above the frame modifier. This allows you to see the outline
    of the VStack before you apply the frame.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: You want the emojis to be in the middle of the view. To make sure they aren’t
    squished in the middle of the view, set the maxWidth to infinity.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: A view can act as a container that holds and organizes other views, known as
    subviews. The VStack that holds all of your code is an example of a container
    view that organizes the two shape subviews vertically.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Look at that beautiful playing card! The next time you’re unsure why your views
    aren’t displaying the way you want them to, don’t forget that you can add a border
    or background to help you debug issues with your views.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: However, if you want your bookshelf to have a specific width, use a frame instead
    of padding. Adding a border after the frame helps you visualize the frame.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Can you figure out a way to make this happen? Remember that you can add a border
    to visualize how much space your view needs and compare it to how you think the
    view should behave.

- 内容: Step 9
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 14
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Step 1
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Adding a Spacer inside an HStack causes the stack to expand to fill in any remaining
    horizontal space, and pushes the Image view to the .trailing edge.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: The first major problem here is that all of the graphics are squished together.
    Add a frame in HalfCard and set the maxWidth and maxHeight to .infinity. This
    allows the frame to expand to fill any available space offered by the container,
    VStack.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Now that you have fixed the alignment in this card, you can remove any borders
    that you’ve added.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: To add a gap between the circular buttons and the emojis you need to add padding
    below the text.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: Adding a frame to an image can sometimes cause it to look stretched even by
    adding an ideal width and height. For images, it’s often better to use scaledToFill()
    or scaledToFit() instead of a frame.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: In vertical stacks, you can only set the horizontal alignment, like .leading
    or .trailing.
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: A different way to add a row of books aligned to the right edge of the shelf
    is by adding a VStack and setting its alignment to .trailing.
