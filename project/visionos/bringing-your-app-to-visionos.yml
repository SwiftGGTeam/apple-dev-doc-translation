  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Overview'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If you have an existing app that runs in iPadOS or iOS, you can build that app against the visionOS SDK to run it on the platform. Apps built specifically for visionOS adopt the standard system appearance, and they look more natural on the platform. Updating your app is also an opportunity to add elements that work well on the platform, such as 3D content and immersive experiences.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'In most cases, all you need to do to support visionOS is update your Xcode project’s settings and recompile your code. Depending on your app, you might need to make additional changes to account for features that are only found in the iOS SDK. While most of the same technologies are available on both platforms, some technologies don’t make sense or require hardware that isn’t present on visionOS devices. For example, people don’t typically use a headset to make contactless payments, so apps that that use the ProximityReader framework must disable those features when running in visionOS.'

  提示: ''

- 内容: 'Add visionOS as a supported destination for your app'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The first step to updating your app is to add visionOS as a supported destination. In your project’s settings, select your app target and navigate to the General tab. In Supported Destinations, click the Add (+) button to add a new destination and select the Apple Vision option. Adding this option lets you build your app specifically for the visionOS SDK.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When you add Apple Vision as a destination, Xcode makes some one-time changes to your project’s build settings. After you add the destination, you can modify your project’s build settings and build phases to customize the build behavior specifically for visionOS. For example, you might remove dependencies for the visionOS version of your app, or change the set of source files you want to compile.'

- 内容: 'Clean up code that uses deprecated APIs'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Fix any deprecation warnings in the iOS version of your code before you build for visionOS. Apple marks APIs as deprecated when they are no longer relevant or a suitable replacement exists. When you compile code that calls deprecated APIs, the compiler generates warnings and often suggests replacements for you to use instead. visionOS removed many deprecated symbols entirely, turning these deprecation warnings into missing-symbol errors on the platform. Make changes in the iOS version of your app to see the original deprecation warning and replacement details.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'In addition to individual symbols, the following frameworks are deprecated in their entirety in both iOS and visionOS. If your app still uses these frameworks, stop using them immediately. The reference documentation for each framework includes information about how to update your code.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The iOS SDK includes many frameworks that don’t apply to visionOS, either because they use hardware that isn’t available or their features don’t apply to the platform. Move code that uses these frameworks to separate source files whenever possible, and include those files only in the iOS version of your app.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''

- 内容: 'Some frameworks have behavioral changes that impact your app in visionOS, and some frameworks disable features when the required hardware is unavailable. To help you avoid using APIs for missing features, many frameworks offer APIs to check the availability of those features.

- 内容: 'If you built your interface using UIKit, you can still load iOS storyboards into your app, but you can’t customize your interface for visionOS or include 3D content. To include visionOS content in your app, programmatically add your SwiftUI views using UIHostingController or UIViewRepresentable. Alternatively, migrate the relevant parts of your interface to SwiftUI. Moving your interface to SwiftUI gives you less code to maintain and makes it easier to validate that your interface does what you want.'

- 内容: 'Add vector-based or high-resolution images to your project specifically to support visionOS. In visionOS, people can view your app’s content at different angles and different distances, so image pixels rarely line up with screen pixels. Vector-based images work best because they maintain their detail and crispness at any size. For bitmap-based images, use high-resolution images (@2x or better) to ensure your images retain detail at different sizes.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If your app uses an unsupported feature but can function without it, you can still bring your app to visionOS. Remove features that aren’t available and focus on bringing the rest of your content to the platform. For example, if you have an app that lets people write down notes and take pictures to include with those notes, disable the picture-taking ability in visionOS but let people add text and incorporate images they already have.'
