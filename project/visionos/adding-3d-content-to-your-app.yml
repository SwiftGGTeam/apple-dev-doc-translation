- 内容: 'A device with a stereoscopic display lets people experience 3D content in a way that feels more real. Content appears to have real depth, and people can view it from different angles, making it seem like it’s there in front of them.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'When building an app for visionOS, think about ways you might add depth to your app’s interface. The system provides several ways to display 3D content, including in your existing windows, in a volume, and in an immersive space. Choose the options that work best for your app and the content you offer.'

- 内容: 'In addition to giving 2D views more depth, you can also add static 3D models to your 2D windows. The Model3D view loads a USDZ file or other asset type and displays it at its intrinsic size in your window. Use this in places where you already have the model data in your app, or can download it from the network. For example, a shopping app might use this type of view to display a 3D version of a product.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'RealityKit is Apple’s technology for building 3D models and scenes that you update dynamically onscreen. In visionOS, use RealityKit and SwiftUI together to seamlessly couple your app’s 2D and 3D content. Load existing USDZ assets or create scenes in Reality Composer Pro that incorporate animation, physics, lighting, sounds, and custom behaviors for your content. To use a Reality Composer Pro project in your app, add the Swift package to your Xcode project and import its module in your Swift file. For for information, see Managing files and folders in your Xcode project.'

- 内容: 'When you’re ready to display 3D content in your interface, use a RealityView. This SwiftUI view serves as a container for your RealityKit content, and lets you update that content using familiar SwiftUI techniques.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The following example shows a view that uses a RealityView to display a 3D sphere. The code in the view’s closure creates a RealityKit entity for the sphere, applies a texture to the surface of the sphere, and adds the sphere to the view’s content.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When SwiftUI displays your RealityView, it executes your code once to create the entities and other content. Because creating entities is relatively expensive, the view runs your creation code only once. When you want to update the state of your entities, change the state of your view and use an update closure to apply those changes to your content. The following example uses an update closure to change the size of the sphere when the value in the scale property changes:'

- 内容: 'Add collision shapes to the RealityKit entities that support interactions.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The targetedToAnyEntity() modifier provides a bridge between the gesture recognizer and your RealityKit content. For example, to recognize when someone drags an entity, specify a DragGesture and add the modifier to it. When the specified gesture occurs on an entity, SwiftUI executes the provided closure.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The following example adds a tap gesture recognizer to the sphere view from the previous example. The code also adds InputTargetComponent and CollisionComponent components to the shape to allow the interactions to occur. If you omit these components, the view doesn’t detect the interactions with your entity.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'A volume is a type of window that grows in three dimensions to match the size of the content it contains. Windows and volumes both accommodate 2D and 3D content, and are alike in many ways. However, windows clip 3D content that extends too far from the window’s surface, so volumes are the better choice for content that is primarily 3D.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To create a volume, add a WindowGroup scene to your app and set its style to volumetric. This style tells SwiftUI to create a window for 3D content. Include any 2D or 3D views you want in your volume. You can also add a RealityView to build your content using RealityKit. The following example creates a volume with a static 3D model of some balloons stored in the app’s bundle:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Windows and volumes are a convenient way to display bounded 2D and 3D content, but your app doesn’t control the placement of that content in the person’s surroundings. The system sets the initial position of each window and volume at display time. The system also adds a window bar to allow someone to reposition the window or resize it.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When you need more control over the placement of your app’s content, add that content to an ImmersiveSpace. An immersive space offers an unbounded area for your content, and you control the size and placement of content within the space. After receiving permission from the user, you can also use ARKit with an immersive space to integrate content into their surroundings. For example, you can use ARKit scene reconstruction to obtain a mesh of furniture and nearby objects and have your content interact with that mesh.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'An ImmersiveSpace is a scene type that you create alongside your app’s other scenes. The following example shows an app that contains an immersive space and a window:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If you don’t add a style modifier to your ImmersiveSpace declaration, the system creates that space using the mixed style. This style displays your content together with the passthrough content that shows the person’s surroundings. Other styles let you hide passthrough to varying degrees. Use the immersionStyle(selection:in:) modifier to specify which styles your space supports. If you specify more than one style, you can toggle between the styles using the selection parameter of the modifier.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Warning'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Be mindful of how much content you include in immersive scenes that use the mixed style. Content that fills a significant portion of the screen, even if that content is partially transparent, can prevent the person from seeing potential hazards in their surroundings. If you want to immerse the person in your content, configure your space with the full style. For more information, see, Creating fully immersive experiences in your app.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Remember to set the position of items you place in an ImmersiveSpace. Position SwiftUI views using modifiers, and position a RealityKit entity using its transform component. SwiftUI places the origin of a space at a person’s feet initially, but can change this origin in response to other events. For example, the system might shift the origin to accommodate a SharePlay activity that displays your content with Spatial Personas. If you need to position SwiftUI views and RealityKit entities relative to one another, perform any needed coordinate conversions using the methods in the content parameter of RealityView.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To display your ImmersiveSpace scene, open it using the openImmersiveSpace action, which you obtain from the SwiftUI environment. This action runs asynchronously and uses the provided information to find and initialize your scene. The following example shows a button that opens the space with the solarSystem identifier:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When an app presents an ImmersiveSpace, the system hides the content of other apps to prevent visual conflicts. The other apps remain hidden while your space is visible but return when you dismiss it. If your app defines multiple spaces, you must dismiss the currently visible space before displaying a different space. If you don’t dismiss the visible space, the system issues a runtime warning when you try to open the other space.'
