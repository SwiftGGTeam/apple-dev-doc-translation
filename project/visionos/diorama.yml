- 内容: 'Use Reality Composer Pro to compose, edit, and preview RealityKit content for your visionOS app. In your Reality Composer Pro project, you can create one or more scenes, each of which contains a hierarchy of virtual objects called entities that your app can efficiently load and display.'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'In addition to helping you compose entity hierarchies, Reality Composer Pro also gives you the ability to add and configure components — even custom components that you’ve written — to the entities in your scenes.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'You can also design the visual appearance of entities using Shader Graph, a node-based visual tool for creating RealityKit materials. Shader Graph gives you a tremendous amount of control over the surface details and shape of entities. You can even create animated materials and dynamic materials that change based on the state of your app or user input.'

- 内容: 'Diorama demonstrates many of RealityKit and Reality Composer Pro’s features. It displays an interactive, virtual topographical trail map, much like the real-world dioramas you find at trailheads and ranger stations in national parks. This virtual map has points of interest you can tap to bring up more detailed information. You can also smoothly transition between two trail maps: Yosemite and Catalina Island.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Your Reality Composer Pro project must contain assets, which you use to compose scenes for your app. Diorama’s project has several assets, including 3D models like the diorama table, trail map, some birds and clouds that fly over the map, and a number of sounds and images. Reality Composer Pro provides a library of 3D models you can use. Access the library by clicking the Add (+) button on the right side of the toolbar. Selecting objects from the library imports them into your project.'

- 内容: 'A single Reality Composer Pro project can have multiple scenes. A scene is an entity hierarchy stored in the project as a .usda file that you can load and display in a RealityView. You can use Reality Composer’s scenes to build an entire RealityKit scene, or to store reusable entity hierarchies that you can use as building block for composing scenes at runtime — the approach Diorama uses. You can add as many different scenes to your project as you need by selecting File > New > Scene, or pressing ⌘N.'

- 内容: 'At the top of the Reality Composer Pro window, there’s a separate tab for every scene that’s currently open. To open a scene, double-click the scene’s .usda file in the project browser. To edit a scene, select its tab, and make changes using the hierarchy viewer, the 3D view, and the inspector.'

- 内容: 'RealityKit can only include entities in a scene, but it can’t use every type of asset that Reality Composer Pro supports as an entity. Reality Composer Pro automatically turns some assets, like 3D models, into an entity when you place them in a scene. It uses other assets indirectly. It uses image files, for example, primarily to define the surface details of model entities.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Diorama uses multiple scenes to group assets together and then, at runtime, combines those scenes into a single immersive experience. For example, the diorama table has its own scene that includes the table, the map surface, and the trail lines. There are separate scenes for the birds that flock over the table, and for the clouds that float above it.'

If the asset you drag is a type that can be represented as an entity, Reality Composer Pro adds it to your scene. You can select any asset in the scene hierarchy or the 3D view and change its location, rotation, and scale using the inspector on the right side of the window or the manipulator in the 3D view.'

- 内容: 'Add components to entitiesin page link'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'RealityKit follows a design pattern called Entity Component System (ECS). In an ECS app, you store additional data on an entity using components and can implement entity behavior by writing systems that use the data from those components. You can add and configure components to entities in Reality Composer Pro, including both shipped components like PhysicsBodyComponent, and custom components that you write and place in the Sources folder of your Reality Composer Pro Swift package. You can even create new components in Reality Composer Pro and then edit them in Xcode. For more information about ECS, see Understanding RealityKit’s modular architecture.'

- 内容: 'Diorama uses custom components to identify which transforms are points of interest, to mark the birds so the app can make sure they flock together, and to control the opacity of entities that are specific to just one of the two maps.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To add a component to an entity, select that entity in the hierarchy view or 3D view. At the bottom right of the inspector window, click on the Add Component button. A list of available components appears and the first item in that list is New Component. This item creates a new component class, and optionally a new system class, and adds the component to the selected entity.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'If you look at the list of components, you see the PointOfInterestComponent that Diorama uses to indicate which transforms are points of interest. If the selected entity doesn’t already contain a PointOfInterestComponent, selecting that adds it to the selected entity. Each entity can only have one component of a specific type. You can edit the values of the existing component in the inspector, which changes what shows up when you tap that point of interest in the app.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'In Reality Composer Pro, a transform is an empty entity that marks a point in space. A transform contains a location, rotation, and scale, and its child entities inherit those. But, transforms have no visual representation and do nothing by themselves. Use transforms to mark locations in your scene or organize your entity hierarchy. For example, you might make several entities that need to move together into child entities of the same transform, so you can move them together by moving the parent transform.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Diorama uses transforms with a PointOfInterestComponent to indicate points of interest on the map. When the app runs, those transforms mark the location of the floating placards with the name of the location. Tapping on a placard expands it to show more detailed information. To turn transforms into an interactive view, the app looks for a specific component on transforms called a PointOfInterestComponent. Because a transform contains no data other than location, orientation, and scale, it uses this component to hold the data the app needs to display on the placards. If you open the DioramaAssembled scene in Reality Composer Pro and click on the transform called Cathedral_Rocks, you see the PointOfInterestComponent in the inspector.'

  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To load a Reality Composer Pro scene, use load(named:in:), passing the name of the scene you want to load and the project’s bundle. Reality Composer Pro Swift packages define a constant that provides ready access to its bundle. The constant is the name of the Reality Composer Pro project with “Bundle” appended to the end. In this case, the project is called RealityKitContent, so the constant is called RealityKitContentBundle. Here’s how Diorama loads the map table in the RealityView initializer:'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The load(named:in:) function is asynchronous when called from an asynchronous context. Because the content closure of the RealityView initializer is asynchronous, it automatically uses the async version to load the scene. Note that when using it asynchronously, you must call it using the await keyword.'

- 内容: 'Create the floating viewin page link'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Diorama adds a PointOfInterestComponent to a transform to display details about interesting places. Every point of interest’s name appears in a view that floats above its location on the map. When you tap the floating view, it expands to show detailed information, which the app pulls from the PointOfInterestComponent. The app shows these details by creating a SwiftUI view for each point of interest and querying for all entities that have a PointOfInterestComponent using this query declared in ImmersiveView.swift:'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'Create attachments for points of interestin page link'
  提示: ''

- 内容: 'Diorama displays the information added to a PointOfInterestComponent in a LearnMoreView, which it stores as an attachment. Attachments are SwiftUI views that are also RealityKit entities and that you can place into a RealityKit scene at a specific location. Diorama uses attachments to position the view that floats above each point of interest.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'The app first checks to see if the entity has a component called PointOfInterestRuntimeComponent. If it doesn’t, it creates a new one and adds it to the entity. This new component contains a value you only use at runtime that you don’t need to edit in Reality Composer Pro.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'By putting this value into a separate component and adding it to entities at runtime, Reality Composer Pro never displays it in the inspector. The PointOfInterestRuntimeComponent stores an identifier called an attachment tag, which uniquely identifies an attachment so the app can retrieve and display it at the appropriate time.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Next, Diorama creates a SwiftUI view called a LearnMoreView with the information from the PointOfInterestComponent, tags that view, and stores the tag in the PointOfInterestRuntimeComponent. Finally, it stores the view in an AttachmentProvider, which is a custom class that maintains references to the attachment views so they don’t get deallocated when they’re not in a scene.'

- 内容: 'Display point of interest attachmentsin page link'

- 内容: 'Assigning a view to an attachment provider doesn’t actually display that view in the scene. The initializer for RealityView has an optional view builder called attachments that’s used to specify the attachments.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'In the update closure of the initializer, which RealityKit calls when the contents of the view change, the app queries for entities with a PointOfInterestRuntimeComponent, uses the tag from that component to retrieve the correct attachment for it, and then adds that attachment and places it above its location on the map.'

- 内容: 'Create custom materials with Shader Graphin page link'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'To switch between the two different topographical maps, Diorama shows a slider that morphs the map between the two locations. To accomplish this, and to draw elevation lines on the map, the FlatTerrain entity in the DioramaAssembled scene uses a Shader Graph material. Shader Graph is a node-based material editor that’s built into Reality Composer Pro. Shader Graph gives you the ability to create dynamic materials that you can change at runtime. Prior to Reality Composer Pro, the only way to implement a dynamic material like this was to create a CustomMaterial and write Metal shaders to implement the necessary logic.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'Diorama’s DynamicTerrainMaterialEnhanced does two things. It draws contour lines on the map based on height data stored in displacement map images, and it also offsets the vertices of the flat disk based on the same data. By interpolating between two different height maps, the app achieves a smooth transition between the two different sets of height data.'
  提示: ''
  翻译: ''
- 内容: 'When you build Shader Graph materials, you can give them input parameters called promoted inputs that you set from Swift code. This allows you to implement logic that previously required writing a Metal shader. The materials you build in the editor can affect both the look of an entity using the custom surface output node, which equates to writing Metal code in a fragment shader, or the position of vertices using the geometry modifier output, which equates to Metal code running in a vertex shader.'
